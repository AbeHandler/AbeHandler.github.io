            "591 Transforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development outlines a transformative vision with 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) for economic, social and environmental development.1 While only SDG 3, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, focuses on human health, all goals are interrelated. This issue of the Bulletin of the World Health Organization examines the relationship between health and the SDGs. Implementing the 2030 agenda requires a multistakeholder, multi-actor response. Innovations and development in policy, technology and research must include dialogue between governments, the private sector, civil society organizations and nongovernmental organizations; most importantly, strong community involvement is needed.2 The focus of the 2030 agenda on addressing country-level needs is based on the engagement of all actors and sectors, as opposed to the traditional top-down, single-sector approach. Intersectoral governance is at the core of how to approach the social determinants of health,3 and how to address antimicrobial resistance through a one health approach.4 More specifically, to reach target 3.8, to achieve universal health coverage, Member States must ensure access to health services by introducing protection against catastrophic health expenditure.5 Obstacles and financial hardships associated with weak health systems and inadequate financing mechanisms not only exacerbate health inequities, but also jeopardize the achievement of other SDGs.6 For instance, catastrophic health spending7 has pushed almost 100 million people into poverty annually, while leaving over half of the world’s population without access to essential health services.5 Most out-of-pocket payments, the cause of catastrophic expenditure, arise from high medication costs, which are likely to increase in line with the global increase in noncommunicable diseases and the need for long-term treatment. Universal health coverage could therefore contribute to achieving the SDGs by producing equitable and sustainable health outcomes. Many health disparities between people with different socioeconomic status are compounded by gaps in good governance. For instance, corruption makes access to health services, medication and information much more difficult for the vulnerable.6 In addition, factors such as ethnicity, gender and disability can further exacerbate these health disparities.8 Hence, tracking indicators that measure the health of vulnerable groups are essential. Monitoring the status of equitable access to health care could also shed light on the status of human rights and social equality within states.9 Those people not receiving adequate health services are probably also disadvantaged in other social aspects.10 A better understanding of factors contributing to access to health services will help shape policies to attain SDG 3, and support the achievement of other SDGs such as attaining gender equality, reducing poverty and improving education.9,10 Currently, robust data on healthrelated targets and indicators is lacking in many countries; developing better implementation and measurement tools, and linking data across sectors, is a cornerstone of the SDGs and should be a priority in global health policy dialogue.6,10,11 The 2030 agenda also places emphasis on the environmental determinants of health. The 2016 World Health Organization report Preventing disease through healthy environments estimated that 23% of all deaths could be attributed to environmental issues such as air pollution, poor sanitation, exposure to radiation and other environment-related causes.12 Progress on the SDGs that target environmental improvements will also improve health indicators. While countries present national voluntary annual reports at the highlevel political forum held in New York, national and international development communities still lack efficient and effective data collection mechanisms, to better report on the status of the progress of Member States towards the SDGs. The WHO Thirteenth General Programme of Work 2019–2023,13 has introduced an impact framework to measure country results and progress in achieving the health-related targets of the SDGs. This framework can assist in ensuring that Member States are able to collect, monitor and report on such progress. The United Nations and its specialized agencies, should work collaboratively to address social, commercial, economic and environmental determinants of health and to strengthen health systems, contributing to the attainment of all SDGs. ■ The role of health in achieving the sustainable development goals Shambhu Acharya, Vivian Lin & Natasha Dhingra\n",

            "A key objective of information technology (IT) research is to assess the value of technology for users and to understand the factors that determine this value in order to deploy IT resources better. This paper uses structural equation modeling to ascertain the extent to which 3 popular models of users' behavior—theory of reasoned action (TRA), theory of planned behavior (TPB), and technology acceptance model (TAM)—are predictive of consumers' behavior in the context of Internet banking. Unlike other tests of these models, this paper employs independent measures of actual behavior, as well as behavioral intention. The results indicate that TAM is superior to the other models and highlights the importance of trust in understanding Internet banking behavior. Explaining user acceptance of new technology is often described as one of the most mature research areas in the modern-day information technology (IT) literature (e.g., Hu, Chau, Sheng, & Tam, 1999). Researchers in past years have approached technology acceptance from many levels. Some researchers have examined this issue at the firm level by assessing the relationship between IT expenditure and performance (e.g., Banker, Kauffman, & Mahmood, 1993). A second approach has been to examine the determinants of IT adoption and use by individual users (e.g., Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989). As a key dependent variable in the IT literature, understanding use is of increasing theoretical interest. In recent years, a variety of theoretical perspectives have been applied to provide an understanding of the determinants of IT adoption and use, including the intention models from social psychology (Christie, 1981; Swanson, 1982). This stream of research uses behavioral intentions to predict actual use and, in turn, focuses on identification of the determinants of intention. The theory of reasoned action (TRA; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) are especially well researched intention models that have proven successful in predicting and explaining behavior across a wide variety of domains. From this stream of social psychology research, the technology acceptance model (TAM; Davis 1989), an adaptation of TRA, has emerged as a powerful and parsimonious way to represent the antecedents of technology use. These multi-attribute models have long dominated attempts to predict technology acceptance behavior (e.g., Chau & Hu, 2001; Gefen, 2002; Gefen & Straub, 2000; Igbaria, Iivari, & Maragahh, 1995; Szajna, 1994). The critical methodological examination reported in the present paper is a combination of a theoretical critique of these models and an empirical investigation of Internet banking behavior. The present study is concerned with both the theoretical status of the models under review and the sphere of human behavior in which they are applied. Therefore, the context of investigation is of central importance to the interpretation of the results. Before introducing the theoretical critique of these models, therefore, it is necessary to summarize briefly the context of Internet banking in the UK, where the empirical work was undertaken. The conventional focus of Internet banking research is shifting from technological developments to customer behavior. Previous research on Internet banking has pointed out that customer acceptance is the key factor in the future development of Internet banking and has called for further research that facilitates a comprehensive understanding of this customer-based electronic revolution (Lassar, Manolis, & Lassar, 2005). To develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between customers' beliefs and Internet banking acceptance, the next section discusses important theories of technology acceptance.\n",

            "In this study, I seek to unravel the relationship between technological capabilities and operational performance amongst a peer group of integrated oil companies in the upstream petroleum industry. I argue that the development and deployment of technological capabilities and their complex relationship with operational performance is conditioned by the interpretative frameworks, or technology frames, of the firm. The concept of a technology frame builds upon two theoretical flows: organisational sociology (notably Weick) and the resource-based view of the firm (relying specifically on Penrose, Chandler and Teece). The technology frame is defined as the firm’s selfimage of its technological resources, capabilities and opportunities. The technology frame should not be confused with strategy; the frame is comprised of the evident and latent beliefs that provide the context for determining strategy. Using conventional metrics, I compiled a dataset of technological capabilities and operational performance measures for the 10 leading oil companies (‘the majors’) for the period 1984 to 1997. Fieldwork interviews and industry research developed and expanded this analysis. These findings indicate that, not only is the relationship between technological capabilities and operational performance too complex to be modelled by simple variables and functions, but also that the proxy variables reveal the technology frames rather than the technological capabilities of these firms. To explore the technology frame, I consider two elements: the firm’s appraisal of the upstream industry and the nature of the role for technology. The gearing ratio and R&D expenditures are used as indicators of the firm’s appraisal of the dynamics of the upstream industry (in growth or efficiency phases), while the nature of the role for technology (implicit or explicit) is proxied by the inclusion or absence of technology management at the executive board level and the positioning of technology within the Annual Report. The existence and value of the frame as a heuristic is then tested through panel data regressions on key expectations of strategic behaviour and outcomes in the area of technological capabilities of firms. The panel-data econometric evidence supports most of the predicted effects, notably indicating that the growth frame is correlated with an explicit frame, and that the role of technology is correlated with upstream R&D expenditure. The technology frame provides a significant extension to the resource-based theory of the firm by identifying the capability of sensemaking as an integral co-determinant of the firm’s resources and capabilities (or ‘services’ as Penrose terms them). On this basis, I am able to interpret the data on technological capabilities and their complex relationship with operational performance in a more consistent and comprehensive manner than has been achieved before.\n",

            "A significant determinant of the health of Canada’s economy is the success of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Today, SMEs employ over half of all Canadian employees and are responsible for half of the private sector research and development performed in Canada. Despite their importance, SMEs have difficulties attracting startup and expansion capital. LABOUR-SPONSORED VENTURE CAPITAL CORPORATIONS 501 (1998), Vol. 46, No. 3 / no 3 In 1985, the federal government sought to correct this market failure through tax incentives. A number of incentives were offered to encourage pension funds to invest in venture capital. After some initial success, pension funds largely abandoned venture capital investment in the early 1990s. However, another 1985 incentive—the introduction of a matching federal tax credit available to individuals who invest in laboursponsored venture capital corporations (LSVCCs)—created the vehicle that is now the largest source of venture capital in Canada. Currently, the federal and seven provincial governments offer a tax credit to individuals who invest in LSVCCs. An LSVCC is a venture capital corporation established under enabling legislation (federal or provincial) and sponsored by a labour organization. LSVCCs are intended to advance certain public policy goals, such as strengthening venture capital pools, addressing gaps in the financing of SMEs, creating and protecting employment, and defining a new role for unions and workers in the Canadian economy. The growth of LSVCCs has been achieved at a substantial cost to government. After the 1996 registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) season, in which LSVCCs raised almost $1.2 billion (with an aggregate government cost of approximately $470 million, excluding the cost associated with RRSP deductions), the federal and provincial governments dramatically reduced the LSVCC tax credit. Investment in LSVCCs declined to $650 million in 1996-97 and just over $500 million in 1997-98. Today, a number of LSVCCs are petitioning the federal government to reverse the 1996 changes. In the face of these lobbying efforts, the government should carefully consider whether the cost of the LSVCC tax expenditure is justified. This article examines the history, current structure, and costs and benefits of the LSVCC tax expenditure; in particular, the article considers whether the expenditure achieves the government’s policy objectives. A number of criticisms have been levied against the LSVCC tax expenditure. In the authors’ view, some of these criticisms are premature. However, a few criticisms appear well founded: first, some LSVCCs have been extremely slow to invest the requisite amount of capital in SMEs; second, the LSVCC tax expenditure has generally failed to address the low end of the venture capital market; third, labour’s involvement in a number of LSVCCs, particularly in Ontario, is essentially non-existent; and finally, a tax incentive may not be the appropriate mechanism to facilitate a new role for labour in industry, as either an investment adviser or an investor in high-risk venture capital. The article concludes with a survey of several alternatives that may better address the financing needs of SMEs, some of which do not require government expenditure. Ultimately, LSVCCs may be a short-term solution to the market failure associated with venture capital financing. However, long-term solutions must focus on the causes of the market failure rather than its symptoms. 502 CANADIAN TAX JOURNAL / REVUE FISCALE CANADIENNE (1998), Vol. 46, No. 3 / no 3 INTRODUCTION Over the last 50 years, Canadian economic development policy appears to have been oriented primarily toward the needs of big business, with little attention being paid to local entrepreneurship.1 This orientation fails to recognize that the role of big business in job creation and economic prosperity has been declining for close to two decades.2 In the decade leading up to 1987, small business accounted for 80 percent of the new jobs created and one-half of the research and development performed by private sector firms in Canada.3 In the 1980s, the number of businesses in Canada grew by 40 percent, and most of that growth was accounted for by small business.4 By June 1997, 96 percent of registered businesses in Canada had fewer than 50 employees.5 In 1995, employers with fewer than 50 employees were employing 30 percent of all Canadian employees; employers with fewer than 500 employees were employing over 54 percent of all Canadian employees.6 Many private and public sector leaders 1 Canada, House of Commons, Taking Care of Small Business: Report of the Standing Committee on Industry (Ottawa: Supply and Services, October 1994), 2. 2 D.L. Birch, “Who Creates Jobs?” [1981], no. 65 The Public Interest. 3 Canada, Department of Industry, Science and Technology, Small Business in Canada: Growing To Meet Tomorrow, a report to Parliament by the Minister of State (Small Business and Tourism) (Ottawa: Supply and Services, 1989), 5. 4 Supra footnote 1, at 2. 5 Statistics Canada, Business Register, “Canadian Business Patterns” (June 1997, unpublished). 6 These statistics include both private and public sector employees, but do not include self-employed individuals. According to the October 1997 labour force survey, there were more than 2.25 million self-employed individuals, which exceeded the total number of employees in the public sector at that time ( just over 2 million): Statistics Canada, Labour Force Update, Autumn 1997, “The Self Employed,” catalogue no. 71-005-XPB, 6. The following table sets out the number of Canadians employed by firms of various sizes in 1995: Statistics Canada, Small Business and Special Surveys Division (1997, unpublished). Number of Percentage of Size of firm employees employees in firms (number of employees) (000s) of that size or smaller Fewer than 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 989.5 8.87 5-19.9 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,283.8 20.53 20-49.9 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,151 30.67 50-99.9 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 877.8 38.53 100-499.9 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,804.8 54.65 500+ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,059.2 100 These figures include public sector employees. It is difficult to eliminate those employees from the data because many of the categories used by Statistics Canada may include both private and public sector employees (for example, education services and health care services). However, if the most obvious public sector employees are removed (government service industries), the importance of SMEs in the private sector increases significantly. The vast majority of these public sector employees (over 900,000) are in the 500+ category in the above table. If employees in this category are removed, SMEs employed 59.2 percent of all employees, while SMEs with fewer than 50 employees employed 33.4 percent of all employees. LABOUR-SPONSORED VENTURE CAPITAL CORPORATIONS 503 (1998), Vol. 46, No. 3 / no 3 have identified the importance of finding effective ways to supply adequate capital to fuel the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),7 especially those engaged in technology-intensive processes and manufacturing.8 Canadian government policies and programs assist SMEs in various ways. In federal and provincial income tax legislation, there are a number of special tax incentives for SMEs. These measures are usually justified on the basis that SMEs face greater difficulties obtaining capital than do larger corporations. The primary tax incentives in the Income Tax Act9 directed at SMEs are the small business deduction in section 125,10 the capital gains exemption for qualified small business corporation shares in subsection 110.6(2.1),11 the employee stock option provisions in subsection 7(1.1) and paragraph 110(1)(d.1),12 and the deduction for allowable business investment losses (ABILs) in paragraph 3(d).13 Other significant 7 SMEs are generally described as firms with fewer than 500 employees and less than $50 million in assets: Standing Committee on Industry, supra footnote 1, at 2. 8 A good overview of the older literature, the statistical impact of SMEs, and the difficulties faced by SMEs in attracting investment is provided in Mary Macdonald and John Perry, Pension Funds and Venture Capital: The Critical Links Between Savings, Investment, Technology, and Jobs (Ottawa: Science Council of Canada, 1985), chapter 1. 9 RSC 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), as amended (herein referred to as “the Act”). Unless otherwise stated, statutory references in this article are to the Act. 10 A Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) is entitled to a tax credit of 16 percent of its first $200,000 of income from an active business carried on in Canada. In general terms, the small business deduction reduces the federal tax rate to 12 percent. All of the provinces and territories provide a similar tax credit. The federal credit is phased out once the small business corporation has taxable capital employed in Canada in excess of $10 million and is eliminated entirely when taxable capital employed in Canada reaches $15 million. 11 See below under the heading “Conclusions: Tax Expenditure Alternatives: Reduction of Capital Gains Tax on Dispositions of Small Business Investments.” 12 Generally, if an employee receives an option to purchase shares of his or her corporate employer, the difference between the fair market value of the shares and the price paid for the shares (including any amount paid for the option) is an employee benefit that is included in the employee’s income in the year the shares are acquired (subsection 7(1)). However, arm’s-length employees of a CCPC are not taxed on the employee benefit until the year in which the shares are sold (subsection 7(1.1)). In addition, so long as the employee of a CCPC holds the shares for at least two years before their disposition, the employee ma\n",

            "In recent years, the supermarket industry has become increasingly competitive. One outcome has been the proliferation of a variety of pricing formats, and considerable debate among academics and practitioners about how these formats affect consumers' store choice behavior. This paper advances the idea that consumer shopping behavior as defined by average size of the shopping basket and the frequency of store visits is an important determinant of the store choice decision when stores offer different price formats. A recent Wall Street Journal article that summarized the result of Bruno's management switching the chain from EDLP to HILO illustrates the importance of this issue: \"The company's price-conscious customers, used to shopping for a fixed basket of goods, stayed away in droves.\" Thus, the audience for this paper includes practitioners and academics who wish to understand store choices or predict how a change in price format might affect store profitability and the mix of clientele that shop there. \n",
            " \n",
            "This paper attempts to understand the relationship between grocery shopping behavior, retail price format, and store choice by posing and answering the following questions. First, after controlling for other factors e.g., distance to the store, prior experience in the store, advertised specials, do consumer expectations about prices for a basket of grocery products \"expected basket attractiveness\" influence the store choice decision? This is a fairly straightforward test of the effect of price expectations on store choice. Second, are different pricing formats EDLP or HILO more or less attractive to different types of shoppers? To adequately answer the second question, we must link consumers' category purchase decisions, which collectively define the market basket, and the store choice decision. \n",
            " \n",
            "We study the research questions using two complementary approaches. First, we develop a stylized theory of consumer shopping behavior under price uncertainty. The principal features and results from the stylized model can be summarized as follows. Shoppers are defined in a relative sense as either large or small basket shoppers. Thus, we abstract from the vicissitudes of individual shopping trips and focus on meaningful differences across shoppers in terms of the expected basket size per trip. The shoppers make category purchase incidence decisions and can choose to shop in either an EDLP or a HILO store. Large basket shoppers are shoppers who have a relatively high probability of purchase for any given category, and as such they are more captive to prices across many different categories. The first two propositions summarize the price responsiveness of shoppers. In particular, the large basket shoppers are less responsive to price in their individual category purchase incidence decisions; this makes them more responsive to the expected basket price in their store choice decisions. This key structural implication of the model highlights an asymmetry between response at the category level and response at the store level. The result is quite intuitive; a large basket shopper with less ability to respond to prices in individual product categories will be more sensitive to the expected cost of the overall portfolio the market basket when choosing a store. The final proposition derives the price at which a given shopper will be indifferent between an EDLP and a HILO store. The key insight is that as a shopper increases his or her tendency to become a large basket shopper, the EDLP store can increase its constant price closer and closer to the average price in the HILO store. Conversely, as the shopper becomes more of small basket shopper, the EDLP store must lower its price closer to the deal price in the HILO store. Thus, we have the interesting result that small basket shoppers prefer HILO stores, even at higher average prices. \n",
            " \n",
            "The empirical testing mirrors the development of the consumer theory. We test the implications of the propositions using a market basket scanner panel database. The database includes two years of shopping data for 1,042 households in two separate market areas. We first use household-level grocery expenditures to model the probability that a household is a large or small basket shopper. Subsequently, we estimate purchase incidence and store choice models. We find that after controlling for important factors such as household distance to the store, previous experience in the store, and advertised specials, price expectations for the basket influence store choice. Furthermore, EDLP stores get a greater than expected share of business from large basket shoppers; HILO stores get a greater than expected share from small basket shoppers. Consistent with the implications of the propositions, large basket shoppers are relatively price inelastic in their category purchase incidence decisions and price elastic in their store choice decisions.\n",
