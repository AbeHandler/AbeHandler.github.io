Hello, Internet. You've found Abe Handler. I'm a data journalist and software developer. I'm interested in natural language processing, machine learning and information retrieval -- especially in applications related to law, politics and investigative journalism. 

By day, I work at <a href="http://www.thelensnola.org" title="The Lens">The Lens</a> -- a non-profit news website dedicated to Southeast Louisiana. By night, I study in the Computer Science department at The University of New Orleans.
